"The RDF module enriches your content with metadata to let other "
"applications (e.g., search engines, aggregators, and so on) better "
"understand its relationships and attributes. This semantically "
"enriched, machine-readable output for Drupal sites uses the <a "
"href=\"@rdfa\">RDFa specification</a> which allows RDF data to be "
"embedded in HTML markup. Other modules can define mappings of their "
"data to RDF terms, and the RDF module makes this RDF data available to "
"the theme. The core Drupal modules define RDF mappings for their data "
"model, and the core Drupal themes output this RDF metadata information "
"along with the human-readable visual information. For more "
"information, see the online handbook entry for <a href=\"@rdf\">RDF "
"module</a>."
